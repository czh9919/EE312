\section{Introduction}

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. 
The FSM can transit from one state to another state in response to external inputs; 
the transition between states is predefined in the FSM. 
An FSM is defined with a list of state, conditions for each transition, and initial state. 
FSMs are of two types of FSM, which are the Moore machine and Mealy machine. 
A Moore machine is an FSM whose outputs are determined only by its current state. 
This is in contrast to a Mealy machine whose outputs are determined by both its current state and inputs. 
We will use these two structures to design a vending machine based on these two structures.

\section{Design}
\subsection{Module design}

For design an vending machine, we should know how the vending machine works.
This vending machine is a sample machine that based on the FSM.
The process of the machine is that input coins and then choose items like drinking, or water, then it will give changes and output items.
And in the code we devided in three parts. 
The first parts is input coins, this part will gets the coin number changes and the total coin value changes, then select items changes.
The second parts when a state change is detected, this part will start to operate, ready for output
The third part is at the posedge, update the data, and ready to return the coins.

\section{Evaluation}

We pass all the tests except "ItemTest, CoinTest1, and CoinTest2".
