# Lab-report

## Introduction

This project required us to design a 16-bit ALU, which is based on basic logical operators and the variables.
From this project we will learn how to use the operators and variable of the Verilog HDL programming language and how to simulate it.
Such as add operator and how to deal with the overflow.


We use three 16-bit arrays to regard the two 16-bit binary input number and the output number.
The operators are use 4-bit binary number to regard.
We use case structure to realize the operators.
